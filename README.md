Debate Tracker is an app for NSDA debaters made by the debaters.

Unlike other standard timing apps, this one allows you to:
* Record your round history for tournament and practice rounds
* Simultenously keep track of prep times for you and your opponents and the speech times
* Give info about the current speech and when you have to speak
* Create a profile that you can show with opponents before the round

Feel free to make pull requests as the UI can definitely be upgraded!
Have fun!
